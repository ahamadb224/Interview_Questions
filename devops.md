Here's a possible organization of the questions into different DevOps-related topics:

**I. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

1.  How you manage infrastructure as code (IaC) using tools like Terraform or Ansible? What are the challenges you have faced?
2.  Explain how you've utilized Elastic Beanstalk. How is it different from directly managing EC2 instances?
3.  Write a Terraform configuration snippet to create an S3 bucket with versioning and encryption enabled.
4.  Explain the use of Terraform or Ansible in provisioning Azure infrastructure.

**II. Configuration Management**

1.  How to implement idempotency in Ansible? Can you provide an example?

**III. Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)**

1.  Suppose a Jenkins build job fails due to a missing dependency in the Maven build process. How to debug and resolve the issue?
2.  Write a shell script to monitor the status of a Jenkins job and send an email if the job fails.
3.  Create a script to automate the process of creating a new Git branch, pushing changes, and opening a pull request using GitHub's API.
4.  Your pipeline fails during a release stage. How do you troubleshoot and fix the issue?
5.  Automate the process of pulling the latest code from GitHub and building a Docker image.
6.  You need to implement end-to-end CI/CD for a microservices application. Describe your approach, including pipeline stages, testing, and deployment strategies.

**IV. Containerization and Orchestration**

1.  How do you handle large Docker images?
2.  Can you tell me a scenario where you needed to orchestrate multiple Docker containers using Kubernetes or a similar tool?
3.  Write a Python script to list all running EC2 instances and their statuses in a given region.
4.  Write a Python script to list all running Docker containers on a host machine.
5.  Create a shell script to restart a Docker container if it stops.
6.  You need to deploy an application to Kubernetes using Helm charts. How do you approach this task?
7.  What are blue-green deployments, and how would you implement them in a Kubernetes environment?

**V. Cloud Computing (AWS & Azure)**

1.  Develop a script to find and delete all files older than 30 days in a specific S3 bucket directory.
2.  Implement a Terraform module that creates an AWS EC2 instance with a security group allowing only HTTP and SSH access.
3.  You are tasked with migrating an on-premises application to Azure. What steps would you follow?
4.  How to ensure high availability and disaster recovery for Kubernetes-based applications?

**VI. Scripting and Automation**

1.  Write a Bash script to automate the deployment of an application.
2.  How to debug a Bash script that's not executing as expected?
3.  Write a Python script to check the status of a running service on a Linux system.
4.  How to configure a cron job to automate a periodic task in Linux?
5.  Develop a Kubernetes YAML file to deploy a simple Nginx web server.

**VII. Monitoring and Logging**

1.  How to integrate DevOps with monitoring tools like Azure Monitor or Grafana?

**VIII. Security**

1.  How can you ensure that only tested and secure artifacts are deployed to production in your pipeline?
2.  A critical service in Kubernetes keeps crashing. What steps would you take to debug and resolve the issue?

**IX. Web Servers**

1.  Write an Ansible playbook to deploy a web application (e.g., Nginx) on an EC2 instance.

**X. Core DevOps Concepts**

1.  What are the essential Linux commands you frequently use in your DevOps work?
2.  What are canary deployments, and how would you implement them using Azure DevOps?
