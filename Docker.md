Q1. Scenario: Your team has encountered a situation where Docker containers are not starting up due to port conflicts. How would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue?

Q 2. Scenario: You are tasked with ensuring that your Docker images are lightweight and optimized for faster deployment. What strategies would you employ?

Q 3. Scenario: A critical security vulnerability has been discovered in one of your base images. How would you handle this situation?

Q 4. Scenario: Your development team uses different environments (development, testing, production) with different configurations. How would you manage these environment-specific configurations in Docker?

Q 5. Scenario: Your application needs to be deployed on multiple cloud providers. How would you ensure that your Dockerized application is portable and can be deployed across different cloud environments?

Q 6. Scenario: Your Docker containers need to share data with each other. How would you manage persistent data and ensure it's available across container restarts?

Q 7. Scenario: You have a Docker container running in production that needs an urgent update to its application code. How would you apply this update with minimal downtime?

Q8. Scenario: You have multiple microservices running as Docker containers, and one service needs to communicate securely with another over the network. How would you ensure secure communication between Docker containers?

Q9. Scenario: Your team is adopting a microservices architecture with Docker containers, and you need to implement service discovery and load balancing. How would you achieve this?

Q10. Scenario: You need to implement automated testing for your Dockerized application. How would you set up a CI/CD pipeline to achieve this?
